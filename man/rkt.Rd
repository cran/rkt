\title{
Mann Kendall test and Seasonal and Regional Kendall tests (SKT/RKT)
}
\description{
Computes the Mann-Kendall test (MK) and the Seasonal and the Regional Kendall Tests for trend (SKT and RKT) and  Theil-Sen's slope estimator.\cr
When a covariable is defined, this function also computes partial RKT and SKT.\cr
To allow for non-regular sampling dates, input data should be vectors, not time series.
}
\usage{
rkt(date, y, block, cv, correct = F, rep = "e")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{date}{
a mandatory vector of numerical data representing dates, as years or years+decimal. If correction for intra-block correlation is required, dates will be truncated to the year, and no more than one value per block per year will be considered. If two equal dates (or truncated dates) are found, the behaviour of the program is determined by rep
}
  \item{y}{
a mandatory vector of measured data. In this vector, missing data are allowed.
}
  \item{block}{
an optional vector of positive integer numbers representing blocks, i.e. sites, seasons or months, or a code combining both sites and seasons/months. If no blocks are defined, the result will be the Mann-Kendall test.
}
  \item{cv}{
an optional vector containing a covariable, such as river flow or deposition amount. In this vector, missing data are allowed
}
  \item{correct}{
a boolean value. If correct is FALSE, no correction for correlation between blocks is performed. If correct is TRUE, dates are truncated and the correction for correlation between blocks is performed. Note that the truncation is performed in any case, while the correction is performed only if there are more than one block, and more than nine years of data. Default value is FALSE.	
}
  \item{rep}{
a character value. If rep is set to "a", data sharing the same date (or truncated date if correct is TRUE) are averaged. If rep is set to "m", their median is used. For any other value of rep, an error is produced if two or more data share the same date (or truncated date if correct is TRUE). The latter is the default behaviour of the program.
}
}
\details{
The MK test for trend analysis was first proposed by Mann (1945).\cr
Hirsch et al. (1982) derived SKT for trend analysis of monthly data in a single site using seasons as the blocking variable, and Helsel and Franse (2006) extended it to a regional test using sites as the blocking variable (RKT).\cr
The correction for correlation among blocks was introduced by Hirsch & Slack (1984), and the partial test was proposed by Libiseller & Grimvall (2002).\cr
At least 4 data are required for each block.\cr
Correction for correlation between blocks is not performed if less than 10 years of data are available.\cr
If correct is FALSE, data are not required to be sampled monthly or yearly.\cr
